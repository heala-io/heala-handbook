# Sprint Review and Planning Meeting Guideline

The sprint review and planning meeting is an opportunity for team members to share their progress, review the work completed during the previous sprint, and plan for the new sprint. It is a regular event that is held at the beginning and end of each sprint. The Sprint review meetings are moderated by the Product manager/owner to better understand what was accomplished in the previous sprint and what will be accomplished in the current sprint.
