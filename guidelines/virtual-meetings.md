## Share Screen Policy

During virtual meetings, it is important to be mindful of what is shared on screen. Any sensitive or confidential information should not be shared on screen unless necessary. Team members should also ensure that their screens are free of any personal or unrelated information.

Here are some best practices for sharing screen during virtual meetings:

 - Share only specific tabs or sections of your presentation instead of your entire screen. This helps to keep the focus on the important information and minimizes distractions.

 - Make sure that all unnecessary tabs or applications are closed before sharing your screen. This helps to avoid any unexpected pop-ups or notifications that could disrupt the meeting.

 - If you are sharing a video or audio file, test the volume and quality before starting the meeting to ensure that it is clear and audible for all attendees.

 - Use the annotation tools or cursor highlighting to draw attention to specific areas of the screen or to emphasize a point.

 - Make sure to disable any notifications or alerts on your device before sharing your screen. This helps to avoid interruptions or distractions during the meeting.

 - If you are presenting a demonstration or tutorial, it is a good idea to provide a summary or outline of the steps beforehand so that attendees can follow along more easily.

 - Avoid sharing sensitive or confidential information during screen sharing, especially if the meeting is not secure. Use a secure platform for these types of conversations.

## Meeting Types

 - There are several types of virtual tech meetings, including sprint planning and review, team meetings, KPI review meetings, and any other official meetings. Sprint planning and review meetings should be held before and after each sprint to discuss progress and plan for the next sprint. Team meetings should be held regularly to discuss team-specific issues and progress. KPI review meetings should be held once a month to review the team’s KPIs and identify areas for improvement. Other official meetings may be scheduled as needed to discuss specific issues or projects.
