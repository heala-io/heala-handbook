# Codebase Guidelines & Standards

The Codebase Guidelines & Standards are intended to provide a consistent foundation for all members of the HEALA tech team to follow when working on codebase projects. These guidelines are a sample and team leads and team members will be expected to come up with standards that suit the tech stack and language used by each team. It is important that all team members adhere to these guidelines in order to maintain a clean and organized codebase, and to ensure that our products are of the highest quality. By following these guidelines, we can work more efficiently and effectively as a team, and deliver the best possible products to our users.

## Best Practices

 - Follow the language’s style guide: The language’s style guide includes recommendations for coding style, layout, and formatting for Flutter code. Adhering to these guidelines can help to ensure that the code is consistent, readable, and maintainable.
 - Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes: Using descriptive and meaningful names can help to make the code easier to understand and maintain. Avoid using abbreviations or acronyms unless they are well-known and widely understood. Use camelCase for function and variable names, and PascalCase for class names.
 - Use appropriate formatting and layout: Use consistent indentation and spacing to make the code easier to read and understand. Avoid using long lines of code, and consider breaking up complex expressions into multiple lines for clarity. Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code and to improve readability.
 - Use comments to explain the purpose and intent of the code: Use comments to explain the purpose and intent of the code, as well as any decisions or assumptions that were made. Avoid using comments to repeat what the code is doing, as this can make the code harder to maintain. Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious code, and use block comments to provide a summary or overview of a code block.
 - Use appropriate error handling: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and errors, and consider using custom error classes to provide more context and detail about the error. Avoid using bare throw statements, as these can make the code harder to debug and maintain. Use appropriate error messages and log appropriate information to help diagnose and resolve errors.
 - Use appropriate testing: Use unit tests to test individual functions and classes, and integration tests to test the integration of different parts of the codebase. Consider using mocking and stubbing to isolate the code being tested. Use test coverage tools to ensure that a representative sample of the code is being tested.
 - Follow best practices for security: Follow best practices for security, such as using secure protocols and encryption, sanitizing user input, and protecting sensitive data. Consider using tools such as static analysis to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
 - Follow best practices for performance: Follow best practices for performance, such as minimizing the number of network requests, optimizing images and other resources, and using caching where appropriate. Consider using tools such as profiling and performance testing to identify and address any performance issues.

## Important

Team leads should update the sample Codebase Guidelines & Standards with links to their team's specific guidelines. These guidelines should be tailored to the tech stack and programming languages used by the team, and should outline the standards and practices that team members should follow when working on codebase projects. It is important for team members to familiarize themselves with these guidelines and adhere to them in order to maintain the quality and consistency of the team's codebase.
