## Sick leave
### When an employee/teammate can take a sick leave
An employee/teammate can take days off for sick leave or to attend to any personal issues that may impact their work. Employees/teammates can take sick leaves when they are:
- Recovering from sickness.
- Recovering from accidents/injuries.
- Receiving mental/psychological care or counseling.

### Procedures for taking sick leave
- An employee/teammate must properly notify their team-lead about the sick leave.
- The team-lead should notify leadership/HR about the development and follow up on the process of documentation and recovery.
- Proper documentation should be done for future reference to avoid bottles necks that may occur with management.
- If a team lead is requesting for sick leave, the person should notify a higher authority. see organization [organogram](organisational%20structure/organisational-structure.md) for more information.
