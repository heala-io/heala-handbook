## Objective

Objective: Increase technical efficiency, reliability and adoption of HEALA's Healthcare tech offerings by optimizing API response time, transaction success rate, and project completion rate while also expanding our technical partnerships and integrations in order to contribute to the company's overall goal of hitting at least 25,000 transactions in Q1, with 20,000 coming from the API route and 5,000 coming from the App route. This objective will be achieved using the SMART criteria as outlined below with an aim to achieve a KPI attainment rate of 10% by January, 50% by February, and 100% by March.

### SMART Criteria

 - *Specific*: Reduce average API response time to 1 second or less, increase average successful transaction rate to 80%, and increase average project completion rate to 90%.

 - *Measurable*: Track and measure average API response time, transaction success rate, and project completion rate on a monthly basis.

 - *Achievable*: The team has the skills and resources necessary to achieve these improvements through code optimization, performance testing, and process improvements.

 - *Relevant*: Optimizing response time, transaction success rate, and project completion rate will lead to a better user experience and increased customer satisfaction and ultimately increased transactions. Expanding technical partnerships and integrations will increase our reach and impact in the tech industry.

 - *Time-bound*: These improvements will be achieved by the end of Q1 (March 31st).

## Definitions
 - Quality assurance pass rate: To measure the quality assurance pass rate, you can calculate the percentage of test cases that have passed out of the total number of test cases that were run. This can give you an overall pass rate for the quality assurance process. You can also track the pass rate for individual test cases or groups of test cases to identify any areas that may be problematic or require more attention. Additionally, you can track the pass rate over time to see if it is improving or worsening, which can help you identify any trends or areas for improvement in the quality assurance process.
