## Definitions
 - Quality assurance pass rate: To measure the quality assurance pass rate, you can calculate the percentage of test cases that have passed out of the total number of test cases that were run. This can give you an overall pass rate for the quality assurance process. You can also track the pass rate for individual test cases or groups of test cases to identify any areas that may be problematic or require more attention. Additionally, you can track the pass rate over time to see if it is improving or worsening, which can help you identify any trends or areas for improvement in the quality assurance process.
