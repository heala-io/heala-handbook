# Key performance indicators (KPIs)

The tech team at HEALA has identified key performance indicators (KPIs) to help drive efficiency, reliability, and adoption of our healthcare tech offerings. These metrics will be used to measure the success and effectiveness of each team member and the entire tech team in achieving our set goals and objectives. The KPIs will be set at the beginning of each quarter and [reviewed monthly](../guidelines/kpi-review.md) to track and measure progress. The agreed KPIs for Q1 of 2023 are outlined below.

## Q1 Objective

Our objective for Q1 is to optimize the performance and increase adoption of the VHP solution for both the API and App routes with a focus on improving technical efficiency and reliability. To achieve this, we will work to enhance API response time, transaction success rate, and project completion rate, as well as build integration options and establishing technical partnerships and collaborations. By doing so, we aim to contribute to the company's goal of achieving at least 25,000 transactions in Q1, with 20,000 coming from the API route and 5,000 from the App route. We will use the SMART criteria to guide our efforts and aim to achieve a KPI attainment rate of 10% in January, 50% in February, and 100% in March.

## Methodology

The SMART criteria was chosen as the preferred methodology for setting and achieving the KPIs outlined in this document. The acronym stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound, and it provides a framework for defining and evaluating goals to ensure they are clear, achievable, and aligned with overall OKRs of HEALA as shown below.

 - *Specific*: Reduce average API response time to 1 second or less, increase average successful transaction rate to 80%, increase average project completion rate to 90% and build a minimum of 10 integration options.

 - *Measurable*: Track and measure average API response time, transaction success rate, project completion rate etc. on a monthly basis.

 - *Achievable*: The team has the skills and resources necessary to achieve these improvements through code optimization, performance testing, and process improvements.

 - *Relevant*: Optimizing response time, transaction success rate, and project completion rate will lead to a better user experience and increased customer satisfaction and ultimately increased transactions. Expanding technical partnerships and integrations will increase our reach and impact in the tech industry.

 - *Time-bound*: These improvements will be achieved by the end of Q1 (March 31st).

## Performance Tracking

To track and measure progress on the tech team's KPIs, the following tools and methods will be used including data on response times, transaction success rates, project completion rates, technical issue resolution rates, quality assurance pass rates, and the number of technical partnerships established. 

 - **Average response time for API calls:** The tech team will use a monitoring tool such as *Postman* to track the average response time of API calls over time. This data can be collected and tracked on a monthly basis to measure progress towards the 1 second goal.
 - **New sample integrations:** The tech team will track the number of new integrations that have been added to the codebase over time. This data will be tracked manually by the team using *GitHub*.
 - **Successful transaction rate:** The tech team will track the percentage of successful transactions by analyzing data from the payment gateway and other relevant systems. This data will be tracked on a monthly basis and used to measure progress towards the 80% goal.
 - **Technical projects completed:** The tech team will track the percentage of technical projects that have been completed by analyzing data from each of the individual tech team's board on Trello. This data will be tracked on a monthly basis to measure progress towards the 90% goal.
 - **Technical issues resolved:** The tech team will also track the percentage of technical issues that have been resolved within the agreed-upon timeframe by analyzing data from the QA board on Trello. This data will be tracked on a monthly basis to measure progress towards the 90% goal.
 - **Quality assurance pass rate:** The tech team will track the percentage of code that passes quality assurance testing by analyzing data from the QA Test Cases sheet on *Excel* or a testing tool like *Jenkins* or *CircleCI*. This data will be tracked on a monthly basis to measure progress towards the 80% goal.
 - **Technical partnerships:** The tech team will track the number of technical partnerships that have been established by analyzing data from the partnership team, emails, trello, or other relevant systems. This data will be tracked manually by the team or automated using a tool like *Zapier* or *Integromat*.

## Definitions
 - Quality assurance pass rate: To measure the quality assurance pass rate, you can calculate the percentage of test cases that have passed out of the total number of test cases that were run. This can give you an overall pass rate for the quality assurance process. You can also track the pass rate for individual test cases or groups of test cases to identify any areas that may be problematic or require more attention. Additionally, you can track the pass rate over time to see if it is improving or worsening, which can help you identify any trends or areas for improvement in the quality assurance process.
