# Welcome to the Heala Handbook
<hr>

### Mission
<hr>

Heala is a digital platform that allows stakeholders in the Healthcare ecosystem to interact and exchange value. These interactions are between end users (Patients) and Healthcare Providers (Hospitals, Dental Clinics, Optical Clinics), HMOs, Diagnostic centers, and Pharmacies.

### Principles
<hr>

#### Services
All successful products exist because they fulfill a customer problem. Our team should be able to take feedback constantly, validate ideas quickly, test prototypes early and ship often.

#### Respect
We should treat our users, doctors and partners with respect, and this means honest and open communication. The same goes for teammates. With this in our toolkit, we can do the right thing all the time.

#### Trust
We should hire problem solvers and afford them the time, space and resources to create opportunities that move us closer to our stated mission.

### Values
<hr>

#### Care
Give a damn. Empathize with customers. Take time to understand their frustration, needs and desires.

#### Craft
Master it. Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Never stop learning and seeking to improve daily.

#### Team
Work together. Team work makes the dream work. Fill gaps. Have each other's back.

### Culture

### Best practices
<hr>
<ul>
    <li>Follow the style guide</li>
    <li>Request Reviews</li>
    <li>Write tests</li>
</ul>

#### Scout rule
Leave any and all code better than you found it. A repo is like a camp site. If you do not pick up the trash you find, it will eventually turn into a dump site.
<ul>
    <li>If you find a mistake and do nothing, you are now a core contributor to it</li>
    <li>As you solve for mistakes, introduce best practices, add clear notes</li>
</ul>

#### Style guide

##### Branch naming.
We have three primary branch categories
<ul>
    <li><strong>feature</strong>: For new features. Sample: <i>feature/hmo-plans</i> </li>
    <li><strong>updates</strong>: For updates on an existing feature. Sample: <i>update/doctor-data</i></li>
    <li><strong>fix</strong>: For bug fixes to an existing feature. Sample: <i>fix/consultation-time</i></li>
</ul>

##### Reviews and merge strategy.
<ol>
    <li>Create your local branch following the branch naming scheme</li>
    <li>Make changes</li>
    <li>Push changes</li>
    <li>Request reviews and get at least one approval</li>
    <li>Discuss on the PR and make changes if necessary</li>
    <li>Merge to <strong>staging</strong> if you get at least one approval </li>
</ol>
