# Daily Scrum Guidelines

The daily scrum is a brief update from team members that is submitted on the #standups channel on HEALA’s workspace on Slack.
The purpose of the daily scrum is to keep team members informed, aligned, and focused on shared goals.

## Format
A bot will prompt users at 10:00 AM every weekday in the form of a chat questions. The questions will include:

> “What did you do since yesterday?”

> “What will you do today?”

> “Anything blocking your progress?”

Answers by team members should be brief and descriptive enough.
